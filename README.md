## Calculator Project
A simple, interactive calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to perform essential arithmetic operations. 

The calculator provides support for chaining calculations and can handle basic operations with real-time display updates.

Completing this project majorly showcases my understanding of foundational JavaScript skills such as logic, DOM manipulation, functions and using event delegation to handle what happens when users click on various buttons on the calculator.

## Features
- Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculation.
- Negative and Decimal Handling: Allows input of negative numbers and decimal values for accurate calculations.
- Chaining Operations: Users can chain calculations; the previous result is used as the first operand for the next calculation.
- Error Handling: Displays "Math Error" for invalid operations, like division by zero.
Clear and Delete Functions: Clear the entire calculation or delete the last entered number.
